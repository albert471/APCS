# APCS
Some Assignments from my AP Computer Science Class.  These are mainly here to show some of my initial coding work in High school (and to document some improvement over the years).

Some of the larger projects are Life (game of life), Cannonball, and CRCoinReturner

All of the code is in Java, and I used BlueJ for the most part when completing these assignments. I have uploaded the local copies of any projects I had on my computer; since we submitted our code electronically, this may not be the most updated list of assignments or versions of all the files.
